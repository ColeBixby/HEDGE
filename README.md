Instructions for running code on HEDGE
1. Link VS Code with your respective github account which will allow you to open and modify this repository
  
2. Within the VS Code "Extensions" tab, download the PyMakr extension
  
3. Ensure the Rasberry Pi Pico is connected to your computer with the provided micro USB to USB cable (an adapter is necessary if using USB-C)
  
4. Open the PyMakr interface in VS Code by selecting it on the left side of your screen

<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

5. If the Pico is on and properly connected to your computer, you should see it under the "DEVICES" tab. Click the lightning bolt icon to establish connection

<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
    
6. Once connected, under the "PROJECTS" tab select "Upload Project"

<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

7. The code should now be successfully uploaded to the pico and can be run by right clicking on main.py, and selecting "Run file on device" under the pymakr dropdown. A separate dropdown should then open where you can select the necessary device (the same device from step 4)

<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

8. The code should now be actively running and live output can be seen by selecting the "Open terminal history" button under the device options menu in the PyMakr extension window
